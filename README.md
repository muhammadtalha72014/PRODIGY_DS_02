Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains my data analysis and machine learning project on the Titanic dataset. The analysis was performed using MS Excel for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the modeling was done using Python and various machine learning libraries.

Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used for binary classification tasks. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, class, etc.

Steps Involved
Data Collection and Processing

Loaded the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Displayed the first few rows to understand the structure of the data.
Handling Missing Values

Identified columns with missing values.
Used strategies such as filling missing age values with the median and embarked with the mode.
Data Analysis

Explored the dataset using descriptive statistics.
Used pivot tables to find patterns related to survival rates based on different features.
Data Visualization

Created visualizations to understand the relationships between variables.
Plotted survival rates by gender, class, and age.
Encoding Categorical Variables

Converted categorical variables into numerical format using label encoding.
Feature Selection

Selected relevant features for model training.
Split the data into training and test sets.
Model Training and Evaluation

Trained a Logistic Regression model.
Evaluated the model using accuracy score.
Key Learnings
Data Cleaning: Managing missing values is essential for building robust models.
EDA: Understanding the data through visualization and statistics helps in feature engineering and selection.
Modeling: Logistic Regression is a good starting point for binary classification tasks.
Conclusion
This project enhanced my understanding of the end-to-end process of data analysis and machine learning. From cleaning data to visualizing patterns and building predictive models, each step is crucial for extracting valuable insights and making accurate predictions.
